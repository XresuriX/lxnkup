The purpose of this is to record my thoughts as I work on this project. I'll create a doc for each app I do work on to speak on what I did and why I did it.
This Project is meant to be a social media site the primary means of socialization is through posts(text/multimedi/hybrid),I also want to develope it to allow streaming and online calling and multiplayer gaming.
Big goals i know, but one step at a time.

Been a minute since I've updated this hopefully that'll change going forward as we are getting closer to mvp status and potential launch.
So here's what's new:
The projects name is lxnkup
it is a social media app for sharing thoughts and ideas in various media forms
it currently has core Profile users reports posts comments notifications activities medialog apps I'll explain them
further in their own apps this doc is for explaining where I am currentlyand where I'll be going next.

As of the timeof this doc being written I've made lxnkup to be a twitter clone with a twist,
currently most of the core functionality has been implemented but due to time they havent been tested prooperly,
I will be writing tests starting soon
