The profile model is builded on django allauth user model as it comes pre configured with cookiecutter-django.
Becasue of allauth's design I'll be configuring the adapter to autho create a profile once the user authenticates their email
I'm using allauth headless so I'll need to properly configure it so I can use it.
Need to check if I need to create a custome save function that calls super save so that signals can be sent to my reciever function.
